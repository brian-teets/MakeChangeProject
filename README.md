## Make Change Project 

### Week 1 Homework for Skill Distillery 

## Overview 

Cash register simulator.

In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. 

We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency:
($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. 

Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.

Hint: Mod operator 

## User Stories

User Story #1
The user is prompted asking for the price of the item.

User Story #2
The user is then prompted asking how much money was tendered by the customer.

User Story #3
Display an appropriate message if the customer provided too little money or the exact amount.

User Story #4
If the amount tendered is more than the cost of the item, display the number of bills and coins that should be given to the customer.

## Lessons Learned 

* The modulus operator
* Don't stay stuck! Don't be afraid to ask for help. 

The modulus operator was very important to the implementation on this project. 

I got stuck for a while on how to approach User Story #4. Getting into a Zoom meeting room with one of the TAs and talking through the issue helped me considerably. SD John walked me through how to approach declaring my variables in my else if block using the modulus operator. Once he helped walk me through the first couple of declarations, the rest of the variable declaration expressions made a lot of sense.
