## Overview 

Cash register simulator.

In the cash register we will calculate the amount of change returned to a customer based on the purchase price and the amount tendered. 
We will also notify the attendant how many of each piece of currency ($20 ,$10 ,$5 ,$1, .25c, .10c, .05c, .01c) is needed to make the change for the customer. Change should be provided using the largest bill and coin denominations as possible. Denominations that are not used should not be displayed.
